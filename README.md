# mechanical-switch-sim
Basic simulation of Cherry blue mechanical switch in Unity

This program is from a school project for MEEN 381 at Texas A&M University which was from the Spring '17 semester. The project was to demonstrate modeling a dynamic system. Further explanation of the physics model can be seen under the Documents folder where there is a project presentation and report.
